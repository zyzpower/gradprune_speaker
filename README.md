# gradualpruning_speaker_adaptation
This is the source code of our method proposed in paper "A Unified Speaker Adaptation Approach for ASR" accepted by EMNLP 2021.

We use the transformer model in Espnet toolkit as the model architecture, and the gradual pruning is achieved by editing code in espnet/espnet/asr/pytorch_backend/asr.py.
